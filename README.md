# Blog CMS

The Blog CMS (content management system) is a site for authoring and editing blog posts as well as managing comments. It is designed to work seamlessly with the [Blog API](https://github.com/kristenmazza/blog-api) and the [Blog Client](https://github.com/kristenmazza/blog-client). This CMS provides a basic, user-friendly interface for administrators to manage blog content.
